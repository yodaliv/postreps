    <p>POSTREPS PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT<br>
    Customer understands that the primary services provided by PostReps are the installation and removal of customer provided signage at the requested location.  Customer understands that while there are no equipment rental fees associated with these services there are PostReps materials (e.g. sign posts, stakes, brochure boxes, flyers, hardware, solar lights, etc.) that will be utilized and that customer assumes all responsibility for any lost, damaged, or stolen PostReps equipment.
    Customer is responsible to leave all accessories and hardware behind for us to remove. Removal of any part of our property by the customer will be subject to fines and termination of service.</p>

    <p>AGENT AND OFFICE SIGNS<br>
    PostReps makes no warranty or guaranty that signs won’t get damaged. Signs in the possession of PostReps are frequently moved, shifted, transported, and bumped. While we make every effort to separate and handle client’s signage with care, we do not make any guarantees that they won’t get damaged. Having us store your signs and/or riders is at your own risk.
    We caution agents against the use of signs that exceed a size of 24” x 24”. Experience has shown that larger panels get damaged far more quickly in the elements than those at or below this recommended size. It is also recommended that larger panels have a side anchor grommet placed about 24” down the side.  Always check your local and city ordinances for sign sizes. Some cities and counties have restrictions on the size and style of real estate panels it is the customers responsibility to verify and abide by these rules and ordinances.</p>

    <p>USER AGREEMENT<br>
    Customer agrees to provide accurate information including time, place, address, cross street, map coordinates, and placement instructions for all orders. Customer agrees to secure written permission from all HOA, Property Owners, and or City Officials for authorization to install any signage on requested property.   Customer is not allowed to remove or install PostReps signposts without prior approval in writing. Moving a post from the initial install location to any other property is a violation of our policy and customer will be charged an install fee for the new location reguardless of who installed the post. Customer agrees to notify homeowner of the sign installation and of such restriction and accepts responsibility for homeowner’s action related to PostReps equipment. Vacant Land and New Construction projects require a plat map supplied by customer. Customer agrees to pay rescheduling fees up to the cost of the installation if the information, address, or location of the property is not accurate or clear.</p>

    <p>INACTIVE AND SOLD LISTINGS<br>
    Customer agrees to promptly issue a “Removal” request for any listing that is no longer active within 2 business days of listing closing or going inactive.
