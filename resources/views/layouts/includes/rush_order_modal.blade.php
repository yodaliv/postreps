                    Requesting a “Rush Order” DOES NOT GUARANTEE the request will be fulfilled. Each rush order must be
                    approved by a member of our staff. If we are not able to schedule a rush order, you will not be
                    charged the rush order fee and the order will be completed on the following business day.
                    If we make an attempt to find the property and are not able to complete the install, you understand
                    you will still be charged the rush order fee. Please be certain the address, pin placement, and
                    information in your order are accurate.
